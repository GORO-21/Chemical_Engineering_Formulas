# Chemical_Engineering_Formulaes
In this repository I will be coding the formulas which are widely used in chemical engineering. The code in this file will be python based along with libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib etc.This repository will also have Python based chemical engineering calculators.


** FILE ** --- Ideal Gas Law Calculator.ipynb
** DESCRIPTION** --- Calculates pressure, volume, number of moles, temperature using Ideal Gas Law.
** USAGE** --- Run in Jupyter notebook with Python and Numpy installed. Enter three variables, leave one blank to calculate. 


** FILE ** --- Arrhenius Equation.ipynb
** DESCRIPTION** --- This arrhenius equation solver can solve for k and T. If you have a target k then this solver will give you temperature required to reach the target k. The solver also plots the graph between temperature and rate constant.
** USAGE** --- Run in Jupyter notebook with Python,Numpy and Matplotlib installed. Enter the values of k or T for whichever case you want to solve or plot the graph.

** FILE ** --- Fanning Friction Factor.ipynb
** DESCRIPTION** --- This module solver solves for Reynolds number(for laminar or turbulent flow), fanning friction factor and pressure drop in pipe.
** USAGE** --- Run in Jupyter notebook with Python, math python module, and Scipy installed. Enter the values of parameters required and get the values of Reynolds number, Fanning friction factor, and pressure drop.

** FILE ** --- Ideal Batch Reactor.ipynb
** DESCRIPTION** --- This module solver solves for ideal batch reactor and finds time to reach a specific conversion along with concentration after conversion.
** USAGE** --- Run in Jupyter notebook with Python, math python module, numpy and Scipy installed. Enter the given parameters to get the time to reach the specific conversion along with the final concentration. 

** FILE ** --- Onda's Relation.ipynb
** DESCRIPTION** --- This module solver finds the mass transfer coefficient in liquid side (k_L) and plots the graph for k_L vs Liquid Mass flux.
** USAGE** --- Run in Jupyter notebook with Python, math python module, numpy and Scipy installed. Enter the given parameters to get k_L and graph.
